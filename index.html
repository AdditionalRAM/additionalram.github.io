            <h2 class="specialfont">About Me</h2>
            <p>I am located in Germany and currently studying high school. My absolute favorite hobby is programming.</p>
            <p>I started learning programming when my father sent me to a course while I was in second grade (2014), where I learnt Scratch and Lego Mindstorms.</p>
            <p>Since then, I have gone to other courses too. But mostly I have been learning how to code on my own, at home.</p>
            <p>In 2018, I started learning Game Development with (unfortunately) Unity and C#. In 2023, I finished the Responsive Web Design certification on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/additionalram/responsive-web-design" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>. </p>
            <p>If you're interested, make sure to check out my projects in the <a href="../projects">Projects</a> page!</p>

        <div class="my-goals">
            <h2 class="specialfont">My Goals</h2>
            <p>My current goal is to finish learning JavaScript in order to better use it for frontend and backend development.</p>
            <p>I am also aiming to make multiple websites for local stores, at first free of charge, in order to expand my web development portfolio.</p>
            <p>I also want to earn enough money before February 2024 in order to purchase a tablet that I can use at school and finally get rid of the pen and paper.</p>
