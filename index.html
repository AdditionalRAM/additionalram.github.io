            <p class="totransition">RAM++ is a community for developers and tech enthusiasts.</p>
            <p class="totransition">Networking is crucial in development, which is something I failed to realize when getting started.</p>
            <p class="totransition">For that reason, I created <strong>RAM++</strong>, a community where you can meet, connect and collaborate with other developers.</p>
            <p class="totransition">Regardless of whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, make sure to check out <a href="../rpp">RAM++</a>!</p>

            <h2 class="specialfont totransition">About Me</h2>
            <p class="totransition">I am located in Germany and currently studying high school. My absolute favorite hobby is programming.</p>
            <p class="totransition">I started learning programming when my father sent me to a course while I was in second grade (2014), where I learnt Scratch and Lego Mindstorms.</p>
            <p class="totransition">Since then, I have gone to other courses too. But mostly I have been learning how to code on my own, at home.</p>
            <p class="totransition">In 2018, I started learning Game Development with (unfortunately) Unity and C#. In 2023, I started learning web development and received certificates on <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/additionalram/responsive-web-design" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a>. </p>
            <p class="totransition">If you're interested, make sure to check out my projects in the <a href="../projects/">Projects</a> page!</p>

        <div class="my-goals">
            <h2 class="specialfont totransition">My Goals</h2>
            <p class="totransition">My end goal is to become a full stack developer.</p>
            <p class="totransition">For now, I am learning front end, gaining experience and extending my portfolio.</p>
